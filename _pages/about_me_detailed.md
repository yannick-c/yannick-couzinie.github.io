I am currently a Postdoc jointly at the University of Tokyo and Quemix Inc. and
as such a member of the Sustainable Quantum AI consortium.  My research mainly
concerns algorithms for gate based quantum computation, quantum annealing and
machine learning techniques at the interface with materials science and
optimization problems. This is done by either working directly on quantum
computers or by using classical simulation.

Academic history
=====
I started studying _Physics_ in Hamburg in 2013 and from the beginning was
mainly interested in theoretical physics. My [Bachelor's
thesis](/theses/bachelor-thesis) was in condensed matter physics on the Kondo
effect supervised by [Michael Potthoff](https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/th1/personen/potthoff-michael/potthoff-michael.html)
and Mirek HÃ¤nsel.

I went to Munich for my Master's to study _Theoretical and Mathematical
Physics_ and took classes ranging from differential geometry, string theory,
quantum electro dynamics to general relativity. My main interest was on the
interface between statistical physics and probability theory. My  [Master's
thesis](/theses/master-thesis) in probability was supervised by [Martin
Heydenreich](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~heyden/) and [Christian
Hirsch](https://christian-hirsch.netlify.app). I worked on a toy model inspired
by biological neural networks, and the thesis research
also resulted in a [reviewed
paper](/publication/2021-weakly-reinforced-polya-urns-on-countable-networks).

I finally pursued this direction with a Ph.D. under the supervision of [Fabio
Martinelli](http://www.mat.uniroma3.it/users/martin/) in Rome to work on
Kinetically constrained models which are a mathematical model of glass forming
liquids. This resulted in my [Ph.D.  thesis](/theses/phd-thesis) and two standalone papers
for the two subjects I cover in my thesis. The first half of my thesis is
published in [a paper with Fabio
Martinelli](/publication/2022-on-a-front-evolution-problem-for-the-multidimensional-east-model)
and the second half is published as [a single author
paper](/publication/2022-multicolour-east-model).

Following my Ph.D. I decided to continue in a more physical research direction
and started a Postdoctoral research in quantum computing under the
supervision of [Matsushita
Yu-ichiro](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=8oHWexAAAAAJ&hl=en)
at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and since March 2024 at the University of
Tokyo. Our goal is to find quantum algorithms that provide actual real world
use cases for quantum computers at the interface of optimization problems and
materials science.

Coding
=====
During my time in Munich I have also started working for a
[startup](https://cognostics.de/) in which I learned the ropes of
working in a team in git and writing well documented code.  Besides
implementing machine learning algorithms in, among other things, speech
recognition, I also devised and implemented more classical algorithms on
graphs in Python. My biggest project included working with linguists and
translating a natural language text into a graph structure which is
machine-readable and analysable.

Part of my duties also included overseeing the open tickets on a backend
project assigned to me and making sure that coding standards were
respected.

Some of my coding projects in C and Python are presented in [the
projects tab](/projects).

In 2020, during quarantine, I have worked through textbooks
OS-programming with the eventual goal of working on the Linux kernel.

Languages
-----
Besides theoretical physics and coding, language learning is a big passion of
mine. I grew up in a Franco-German family and assimilated the English language
mostly through the internet and the Italian language during my stay in Rome.
When I was 18 I started studying Japanese and am currently studying for the
[Level Pre-1 of the Kanji aptitude
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei#Level_Pre-1). My passion for
Chinese characters and my desire to understand more the origins of the written
Japanese language finally also led me to pick up studying Mandarin.

Hiking
-----
When I am not doing Mathematics, coding or learning languages I love doing
badminton, outdoor sports and in particular hiking and trekking. Besides
frequent of day-trips in whichever region I currently find myself in, I have
also completed a 30 day, 550km trek with a friend starting in Austria, going
through Slovenia and ending in Italy.
