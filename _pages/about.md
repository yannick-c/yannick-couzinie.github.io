I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Roma Tre University in Rome, Italy and am
waiting for the review results of my thesis to defend it soon. I am an avid
coder besides being a Mathematician and am looking to combine both these
aspects into future work.

Academic history
=====
I started studying _Physics_ in Hamburg in 2013 and found an early passion for
theoretical physics and in particular cosmology, even if my [Bachelor's
thesis](/theses/bachelor-thesis) was in condensed matter physics.

I went to Munich for my Master's to study _Theoretical and Mathematical
Physics_ and took classes ranging from differential geometry, string theory,
 quantum electro dynamics to general relativity. In Munich I also found
 a renewed interest in mathematical statistical physics and biophysics,
 and it was in a stochastic processes class by Christian Hirsch that I
 found a passion for probability theory. I then started a [Master's
 thesis](/theses/master-thesis) in probability theory working on a toy model inspired
 by biological neural networks. Despite having almost no
 theoretical background at the beginning, through intensive study, I managed to produce
 a thesis which also resulted
in a [nice
paper](/publication/2021-weakly-reinforced-polya-urns-on-countable-networks).

I finally pursued this direction with a Ph.D. under the supervision of Fabio
Martinelli in Rome to work on Kinetically constrained models which are a
mathematical model of glass forming liquids. So in a sense, this Ph.D. closes
the loop to my Bachelor's by being a probability theory thesis on a condensed
matter physics inspired subject. I recently turned in my thesis and it is
currently under review. The first half of my thesis is published in [a paper
with Fabio
Martinelli](/publication/2022-on-a-front-evolution-problem-for-the-multidimensional-east-model)
and the second half is currently [being prepared](/publication/2022-multicolour-east-model).

Coding
=====
During my time in Munich I have also started working for a
[startup](https://cognostics.de/) in which I
learned the ropes of working in a team in git and writing well documented code.
Besides implementing machine learning algorithms in, among other things, speech
recognition, I also devised and implemented more classical algorithms on
graphs in Python. My biggest project included working with linguists and translating a
natural language text into a graph structure which is machine-readable and
analysable.

Part of my duties also included overseeing the open tickets on a backend
project assigned to me and making sure that the [pep8 coding
convention](https://pep8.org/) is respected.

My fascination with the topic of Kinetically constrained models also stems
from the fact that they lend themselves well to simluation. Some of my coding
projects in C and Python are presented in [the projects tab](/projects).

In 2020, during quarantine, I have worked through textbooks on [computing
systems](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/index.html), [OS
programming](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and I have started to
work through [exercises](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/labs/) on the
Unix-based xv6 operating system in RISC-V in the hopes of being able to use
this knowledge in the near future.

Languages
-----
Besides theoretical physics and coding, language learning is a big passion of
mine. I grew up in a Franco-German family and assimilated the English language
mostly through the internet and the Italian language during my stay in Rome.
When I was 18 I started studying Japanese and am currently studying for the
[Level Pre-1 of the Kanji aptitude
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei#Level_Pre-1). My passion for
Chinese characters and my desire to understand more the origins of the written
Japanese language finally also led me to pick up studying Mandarin.

Hiking
-----
When I am not doing Mathematics, coding or learning languages I love doing
outdoor sports and in particular hiking. Besides frequent of day-trips in
whichever region I currently find myself in, I have also completed a 30 day,
550km trek with a friend starting in Austria, going through Slovenia
and ending in Italy.
