I am currently a Postdoc jointly at the University of Tokyo and Quemix Inc. and
as such a member of the Sustainable Quantum AI consortium.  My research mainly
concerns algorithms for gate based quantum computation, quantum annealing and
machine learning techniques at the interface with materials science and
optimization problems. This is done by either working directly on quantum
computers or by using classical simulation.
