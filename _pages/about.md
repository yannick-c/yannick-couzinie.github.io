I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Roma Tre University in Rome, Italy and am
waiting for the review results of my thesis to defend it soon. I am an avid
coder besides being a Mathematician and am looking to combine both these
aspects into future work.

Academic history
=====
I started studying _Physics_ in Hamburg in 2013 and found an early passion for
theoretical physics and in particular cosmology, even if my [Bachelor's
thesis](/theses/bachelor-thesis) was in condensed matter physics.

I went to Munich for my
Master's to study _Theoretical and Mathematical physics_ and took everything
from differential geometry, string theory, quantum electro dynamics to general
relativity. While I was getting more and more disillusioned with research in
this area of theoretical physics, I started to take classes in more diverse
ares a like biophysics and more advanced condensed matter physics. It was in a
stochastic processes class by Christian Hirsch that I found a passion for
probability theory. I then started a [Master's thesis](/theses/master-thesis)
in probability theory with almost no theoretical background, but through
intensive study managed to produce a thesis which also resulted
in a [nice
paper](/publication/2021-weakly-reinforced-polya-urns-on-countable-networks).

I finally pursued this direction with a Ph.D. under the supervision of Fabio
Martinelli in Rome to work on Kinetically constrained models which are a
mathematical model of glass forming liquids. So in a sense, this Ph.D. closes
the loop to my Bachelor's by being a probability theory thesis on a condensed
matter physics inspired subject. The thesis of is still under review.

Coding
=====
During my time in Munich I have also started working for a
[startup](https://cognostics.de/) in which I
learned the ropes of working in a team in git and writing well documented code.
My main tasks revolved around machine learning applications and devising
more classical algorithms on graphs.

My fascination with the topic of Kinetically constrained models also stems
from the fact that they lend themselves well to simluation. Some of my coding
projects in C and Python are presented in [the projects tab](/projects).

In 2020, during quarantine, I have worked through textbooks on [computing
systems](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/index.html), [OS
programming](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and I have started to
work through [exercises](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/labs/) on the
Unix-based xv6 operating system in RISC-V in the hopes of being able to use
this knowledge in the near future.

Away from keyboard

Languages
-----
Besides theoretical physics and coding, language learning is a big passion of
mine. I grew up in a Franco-German family and assimilated the English language
mostly through the internet and the Italian language during my stay in Rome.
When I was 18 I started studying Japanese and am currently studying for the
[Level Pre-1 of the Kanji aptitude
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei#Level_Pre-1). Some years ago,
apparently getting bored with the intricacies of the Japanese language, I have
also started learning Chinese.

Hiking
-----
When I am not doing Mathematics, coding or learning languages I love doing
outdoor sports and in particular hiking. Besides plenty of day-trips in
whichever region I would currently find myself in I have also completed a 30
day, 550km trek starting in Austria, going through Italy and ending in Italy.
