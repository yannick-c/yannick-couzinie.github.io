Abstract
=====

Consider reinforced Pólya urns on the vertices of infinite graphs with bounded
degree, where the edges of each vertex correspond to a colour in the respective
urn and weights on the edges correspond to the number of balls of the
respective colour. Increments happen based on atoms in independent homogeneous
Poisson clocks with inhomogeneous intensities. For this highly interactive
model, consider the case of sublinear reinforcement. After exploring a sensible
notion of equilibrium distribution for these dynamics, this thesis shows
sufficient conditions on the reinforcement rate so that the weights converge to
the unique equilibrium distribution on infinite graphs of bounded degree.
