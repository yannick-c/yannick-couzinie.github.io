Abstract
=====

A first-order perturbative approach to the Kondo model in the low energy scale
for nanoscale systems is presented. The coupling between any amount of magnetic
impurities, modelled as quantum spins, and spin orbitals in a metallic lattice
can be anisotropic and both local and non-local. While the lattice dimension
and geometry can be chosen freely, the Fermi energy level needs to be
incompletely occupied. The result is an effective coupling model, giving
control over the distinction between under-, complete and overscreening.
Numerical calculations on exemplary one-dimensional systems are then evaluated
and briefly discussed, one of which is a system frequently used to discuss and
measure overscreening.
