Tutoring for the undergraduate course _Math for physicists 1_ that introduces basic concepts
of linear algebra and analysis.

Contents
======
Outlined in [the homepage in
German](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/master/lehrexport/physik/mfp1.html).
Mainly sequences, series, continuity, differentiability and integration of functions with a single variable, vector spaces and systems of linear equations.

My role
======
As part of the lecture the students are split up into classes of 15-20 students
that are lead by tutors, of which I was one. The contents of the lectures of
the respective week are recalled and questions are discussed. The final exam
score can be improved by solving all the homework throughout the semester. The
correction of the homework (and parts of the exam) are also tasks of the tutor,
so every week I discussed the past weeks homework and presented some example
exercises for the next set of exercises.
