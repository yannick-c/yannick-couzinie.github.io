Tutoring for the undergraduate course _Math for physicists 2_ that introduces more
advanced undergraduate linear algebra and calculus.

Contents
======
Outlined in [the homepage in
German](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/master/lehrexport/physik/mfp2.html).
Euclidean and hermitian vector spaces, metric spaces, completeness, bounded
operators, Hilbert spaces, multidimensional calculus, inverse function rule,
differential equations, Fourier series.

My role
======
As part of the lecture the students are split up into classes of 15-20 students
that are lead by tutors, of which I was one. The contents of the lectures of
the respective week are recalled and questions are discussed. The final exam
score can be improved by solving all the homework throughout the semester. The
correction of the homework (and parts of the exam) are also tasks of the tutor,
so every week I discussed the past weeks homework and presented some example
exercises for the next set of exercises.
