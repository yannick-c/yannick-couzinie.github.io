Tutoring for the undergraduate course _Mathematical tools for physicists_
(_Rechnungsmethoden_) in which a nearly exhaustive set of mathematical tools
needed for undergraduate theoretical physics is taught in the span of a
semester.

Contents
======
Outlined in [the homepage in
German](https://www2.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_21_22/r_rechenmethoden_21_22/skript/R-2021-22-Stoffeinteilung.pdf).
Calculus, vector spaces, euclidean spaces, vector products, multidimensional
integrals, partial derivatives, vector fields, linear algebra, Taylor series,
differential equations, optimization with boundary conditions, Fourier series,
complex analysis. 

My role
======
As part of the lecture the students are split up into classes of 15-20 students
that are lead by tutors, of which I was one. The contents of the lectures of
the respective week are recalled and questions are discussed. The final exam
score can be improved by solving all the homework throughout the semester. The
correction of the homework (and parts of the exam) are also tasks of the tutor,
so every week I discussed the past weeks homework and presented some example
exercises for the next set of exercises.
