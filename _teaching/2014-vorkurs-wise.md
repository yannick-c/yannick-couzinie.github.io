Tutoring for the preparatory mathematics course offered to new students of the
physics department.

Contents
======
The University of Hamburg offers a preparatory mathematics course to newly
enrolled students at the department of physics. This covers some basics like
multidimensional integrals, derivations, sequence limits and series to ensure
that every student can follow basic undergraduate physics courses.

My role
======
Half of this course is a lecture held by a professor and for the other half the
students are split up into classes of 15 to 20 students to solve exercises with
the help of a tutor. I was one of these tutors.
