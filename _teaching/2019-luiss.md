Tutoring for the course _Social Network Analysis_ which teaches the basic tools for the
analysis of social networks, drawing from graph theory, probability, game
theory, optimization.

Contents
======
The course starts with basic concepts in graph theory, static and growing
random networks, game theory. Strategic formation of networks, centrality
notions on graphs and games on networks like congestion games.

My role
======
Part of the lecture was a tutoring session in which I prepared a summary of the
weeks contents of the lectures and dealt with any question regarding the
material. The professor assigned homework during the course so each week I
discussed the previous weeks homework and gave hints for the next week.
