This talk covered the portion of my Ph.D. thesis results concerning the multicolour East model (and the associated paper).

# Abstract
We consider the multicolour East model, a new model in the mathematics
literature that is best described as multiple multidimensional East models
sharing the neutral state. Looking at the simplest version, the two-colour East
model in two dimensions we show ergodicity and analyse sufficient conditions to
get asymptotics on the spectral gap in the limit of vanishing transition rates
of one of the two colours. We close the talk by looking at generalisations of
these results and remaining open questions.
