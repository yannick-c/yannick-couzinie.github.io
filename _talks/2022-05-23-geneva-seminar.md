This talk covered the portion of my Ph.D. thesis results concerning the front
evolution of the East model. [Slides can be found here](/files/2022-presentation-geneva.pdf).

# Abstract
In this talk we consider kinetically constrained models (KCM). KCM are Markov
processes that model core properties of the liquid-glass transition. Mathematically they are the
continuous time generalisation with recovery of bootstrap percolation. In particular, we
consider a natural front evolution problem (or alternatively: an infection spreading velocity problem) for
the East process on Z^d, d ≥ 2, a well studied directed KCM. Shape theorems in dimension d ≥ 2
have been notoriously hard to prove for KCM due to the lack of attractiveness. In this talk we show first bounds giving
that the front of the East model is extremely elongated in Z^d as the equilibrium probability
of facilitating vertices vanishes. Together with the board outlines of the proof we give qualitative reasons for this
supported by simulations. These results allow finding a set behind the front that tends to equilibrium and a cutoff of the mixing
time on the d-dimensional cube.
