Abstract
======
We consider the multicolour East model, a model of glass forming liquids
closely related to the East model on $$\mathbb{Z}^d$$. The state space $${(G\cup
\{\star\})}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$$ consists of $$|G|\le 2^d$$ different vacancy types
and the neutral state $$\star$$. To each $$h\in G$$ we associate unique
facilitation mechanisms $${\{c_x^{h}\}}_{x\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$$ that correspond to
rotated versions of the East model constraints. If $$c_x^{h}$$ is satisfied, the
state on $$x$$ can transition from $$h$$ to $$\star$$ with rate $$p\in (0,1)$$ or vice
versa with rate $$q_h\in (0,1)$$, where generally $$q_h\neq q_{h'}$$ if $$h'\neq h$$.
Notably, vertices in the state $$h$$ cannot transition directly to $$h'\neq h$$ and
neighbouring $$h'$$-vacancies do not contribute in satisfying $$c_x^{h}$$. Thus,
there is a novel blocking mechanism between vacancies of differing type. We
find sufficient conditions on the model geometry to have a positive spectral
gap and prove that with $$|G|=2^d$$ the model is not ergodic. For $$d=2$$ we prove
that the model with $$|G|\le 3$$ has positive spectral gap and we find sufficient
conditions on the transition rates for the spectral gap to be given in the
leading order by the spectral gap of the East model on $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$ with
parameter $$q_{\min}=\min_{h\in G}q_h$$ in the limit $$q_{\min}\rightarrow 0$$. In
particular, we prove this when there are $$h\in G$$ with $$q_h\gg q_{\min}$$ by
explicitly constructing mechanisms on which the frequent vacancy types
cooperate to facilitate the East movement of the least frequent vacancies.
