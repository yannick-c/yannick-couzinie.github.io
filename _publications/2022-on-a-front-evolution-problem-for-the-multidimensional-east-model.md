Abstract
======
We consider a natural front evolution problem the East process on
$$\mathbb{Z}^d$$, $$d\ge 2$$, a well studied kinetically constrained model for
which the facilitation mechanism is oriented along the coordinate directions,
as the equilibrium density $$q$$ of the facilitating vertices vanishes.
Starting with a unique unconstrained vertex at the origin, let $$S(t)$$
consist of those vertices which became unconstrained within time $$t$$
and, for an arbitrary positive direction $$x$$, let $$v_{\max}(x)$$,
$$v_{\min}(x)$$ be the maximal/minimal velocities at which $$S(t)$$ grows
in that direction. If $$x$$ is independent of $$q$$, we prove that
$$v_{\max}(x)=v_{\min}(x)^{(1+o(1))}=\gamma(d)^{(1+o(1))}$$ as $$q\rightarrow
0$$, where $$\gamma(d)$$ is the spectral gap of the process on
$$\mathbb{Z}^d$$. We also analyse the case in which some of the
coordinates of $$x$$ vanish as $$q\rightarrow 0$$. In particular, for
$$d=2$$ we prove that if $$x$$ approaches one of the two coordinate
directions fast enough, then
$$v_{\max}(x)=v_{min}(x)^{(1+o(1))}=\gamma(1)^{(1+o(1))}=\gamma(d)^{d(1+o(1))}$$,
i.e. the growth of $$S(t)$$ close to the coordinate directions is
dictated by the one dimensional process. As a result the region $$S(t)$$
becomes extremely elongated inside $$\mathbb{Z}^d_+$$. We also establish
mixing time cutoff for the chain in finite boxes with minimal boundary
conditions. A key ingredient of our analysis is the renormalisation
technique presented
[here](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-probability/volume-44/issue-3/Relaxation-to-equilibrium-of-generalized-East-processes-on-mathbbZd/10.1214/15-AOP1011.full)
to estimate the spectral gap of the East process. Here we extend this
technique to get the main asymptotics of a suitable principal Dirichlet
eigenvalue of the process.
