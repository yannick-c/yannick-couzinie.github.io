Abstract
======
We study the long-time asymptotics of a network of weakly reinforced Pólya
urns. In this system, which extends the WARM introduced by R. van der Hofstad
et. al. (2016) to countable networks, the nodes fire at times given by a
Poisson point process. When a node fires, one of the incident edges is selected
with a probability proportional to its weight raised to a power α<1, and then
this weight is increased by 1.

We show that for α<1∕2 on a network of bounded degrees, every edge is
reinforced a positive proportion of time, and that the limiting proportion can
be interpreted as an equilibrium in a countable network. Moreover, in the
special case of regular graphs, this homogenization remains valid beyond the
threshold α=1∕2.
