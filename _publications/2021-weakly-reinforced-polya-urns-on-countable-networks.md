Abstract
======
We study the long-time asymptotics of a network of weakly reinforced Pólya
urns. In this system, which extends the WARM introduced by [R. van der Hofstad
et. al.
(2016)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-probability/volume-26/issue-4/Strongly-reinforced-P%c3%b3lya-urns-with-graph-based-competition/10.1214/16-AAP1153.full) to countable networks. The nodes fire at times given by a
Poisson point process. When a node fires, one of the incident edges is selected
with a probability proportional to its weight raised to a power $$\alpha<1$$, and then
this weight is increased by $$1$$.

We show that for $$\alpha<\frac12$$ on a network of bounded degrees, every edge is
reinforced a positive proportion of time, and that the limiting proportion can
be interpreted as an equilibrium in a countable network. Moreover, in the
special case of regular graphs, this homogenization remains valid beyond the
threshold $$\alpha=\frac12$$.
