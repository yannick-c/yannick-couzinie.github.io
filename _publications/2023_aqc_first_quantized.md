Abstract
======
We propose an adiabatic time evolution (ATE) method for obtaining the ground
state of a quantum many-electron system on a quantum circuit based on first
quantization for the first time. As a striking feature of the ATE method, it
consists of only unitary operations, which means that it does not require any
ancillary qubits, nor controlled real-time evolution operators. We also provide
a way to prepare an antisymmetrized and non-degenerate initial ground state
that is suitable as an input to an ATE circuit, which allows our ATE method to
be applied to systems with any number of electrons. In addition, by considering
a first-quantized Hamiltonian for quantum-mechanical electron system and
classical nuclear system, we design a quantum circuit for optimal structure
search based on ATE. Numerical simulations are demonstrated for simple systems,
and it is confirmed that the ground state of the electronic system and
optimal structure can be obtained by our method
